LE NANTAIS ANGEL HAIR PASTA SALAD:

1) Boil some salted water for pasta, and while it's coming to a boil, 

2) Make mayonnaise:
       Put a spoonful of dijon mustard, a spoonful of red wine vinegar, 2 egg yolks, salt, and pepper in a small mixing bowl. While beating at high speed with an electric mixer, pour a cup or two of mild oil (like canola) into the bowl, as slowly as possible.  This should take at least five minutes, but you can stop whenever the mayonnaise tastes good to you.  The longer you mix, the stiffer the mayonnaise becomes.

3) Cook 1.5 lbs of angel hair pasta in the water, and while it's cooking,

4) Dice up some cooked chicken meat, mince some scallions, and slice a     drained can of hearts of palm, add them all to a large serving bowl, and stir in the juice from 1 lemon.

5) Drain the cooked pasta, rinsing it with cool water until it is near room temperature.

6) Mix the pasta and mayonnaise into the serving bowl and mix with tongs until combined well.  Add salt and ground pepper as desired.
